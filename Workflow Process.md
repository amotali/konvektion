# Workflow Process

_(TBD: intro about workflow being like a song or something)_

### Revealing what *to do*

#### 1. No Status

This is where all tasks and ideas start. It's a collection point for every initiative, large or small, groundbreaking or incremental.

> **Pro-tip**: Be open to every idea, even those that seem outlandish at first. They could open up avenues of thought that lead to innovative solutions. Putting a below average idea into pool doesn't mean that person is deeply flawed.

#### 2. Up Next

Tasks in this stage have been evaluated and are selected to be worked on. They have moved from potential ideas to defined tasks ready for action.

> **Pro-tip**: Set your task limit to just a few at a time. Let's say, three. Start working on them. You'll soon understand why you can't juggle more than that effectively. Always bear in mind the goal is to juggle effectively, not to juggle everything.

### Tracking *progress*

#### 3. Exploration

At this stage, we delve into the details of the tasks, testing our theories, and uncovering unknowns. This helps us develop a solid understanding and plan for the work ahead.

> **Pro-tip**: Give yourself an hour to just try going in a new direction. After an hour you’ll know for sure why you can’t get there in an hour. Make a note. Take a rest. Then play with whatever blocked your progress.

#### 4. Execution

This is where we put our plans into action. Tasks are initiated, and we work to transform our ideas into reality.

### Reflecting on what's *complete*

#### 5. Done

This is where tasks reach their conclusion. It's a testament to successful work.

> Savour this moment. This is both a well-deserved rest and a launch pad for the next endeavor.

#### 6. On Ice

Some tasks might encounter obstacles or their priority may diminish over time. Such tasks are placed here, written on ice, neither forgotten nor fully remembered.

> **Pro-tip**: Don't view tasks on ice as failures. They could offer valuable lessons or be useful in the future under different circumstances. They could mean time gained by note doing useless work, at least for now.

## Quick Notes

- Feel free to bend the rules. This workflow is our pet, not our boss. Make it like-able for you.
- Again, remember, juggling too many tasks at once is cringe. Focus is cute. (reference to Kanban)
- Think of 'Exploration' and 'Execution' as climbing and then going downhill. It's tough at first, but it gets easier once you see the whole picture. (reference to Shape Up)
- It's not always going to be intense. Note when it feels calm.
