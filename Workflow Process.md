# Navigating Tasks & Progress

The nature of our work is ever-evolving, demanding a dynamic balance between focus and flexibility. 

For this we started managing our work with a classic Kanban board in Github Projects, and liked it for its clarity and focus. Now we're adjusting the workflow to our rather divergent manner of work, on top of [concepts of Kanban](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wEN8DINqEss).

Here's our take on it, a workflow to fill our working memory with the right things in the right sequence. Meet _Kanbanman_.

### Revealing what to do

#### 1. No Status

This stage serves as a repository for all ideas and potential tasks - large or small, groundbreaking or incremental.

> **Pro-tip**: Be open to every idea, even those that seem outlandish at first. They could open up avenues of thought that lead to innovative solutions. Having a seemingly bad idea /or even many of them/ doesn't mean that person is deeply flawed.

#### 2. Up Next

Tasks in this stage have been evaluated and are selected to be worked on. They have moved from potential ideas to defined tasks ready for action.

> **Pro-tip**: Set your task limit to just a few at a time. Let's say, three. Start working on them. You'll soon understand why you can't juggle more than that effectively. 

### Tracking progress

It's tricky to show progress. Tasks are like hills. The climb up can be an intense exploration, but once you're at the top with charted map, it's a clear run downhill. Tough at first, but you get the hang of it. More on this in [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

#### 3. Exploration

Here, we delve into the details of the tasks, tackling unknowns, and testing theories. This phase paves the way for successful execution, better understanding, and preparing us for the task at hand.

> **Pro-tip**: Give yourself an hour to just try going in a new direction. After an hour you’ll know for sure why you can’t get there in an hour. Make a note. Take a rest. Then play with whatever blocked your progress.

#### 4. Application

Putting our plans into action, we elegantly execute our steps, transforming our ideas and experiments into production. After all the insight we gathered from the previous explorations, this should feel like we glide downhill. 

### Reflecting on what's complete

#### 5. Done

This is where tasks reach their conclusion. It's a testament to successful work, a zone for well-deserved rest and a launch pad for the next endeavor.

#### 6. On Ice

Some tasks might encounter obstacles or their priority may diminish over time. Such tasks are placed here, written on ice, neither forgotten nor fully remembered.

> **Pro-tip**: Don't view tasks on ice as failures. They may offer valuable lessons or be useful in the future under different circumstances. They may also mean time gained by note doing useless work.

## Quick Notes

- Embrace the rhythm of feedback and iteration. Try things out, talk with your friends, and learn as you go. 
- There will be moments of intensity and calmness in our performance. Cherish both.
- It's a dance, not a race. This workflow is like the [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOOb2XFtQDM) setting the rhythm. Feel the beat and move your own way.
- Again, remember: too many moves at once is cringe; focus is cute; balance is key. 
- Another thing that is cringe is a guide that doesn't help much. Contributions are welcome.
