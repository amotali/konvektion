### Workflow Process

Think of our workflow as a rhythm: potential, action, reflection - repeat.
The aim of the process is visualizing work, defining and prioritizin tasks, limiting *work in progress* to maintain focus and avoid getting overwhelmed.

#### Section I: Initiation

1. **No Status**: This is an inbox for our tasks and ideas. Every brainwave, every thought, every envisioned goal, innovative or derogatory in nature, it all starts here.

2. **Up Next**: Tasks in this stage have been evaluated and are selected to be worked on. They've moved from the pool of potential into the realm of reality, primed for action. 

#### Section II: Progress

> Every piece of work has two phases. First there’s the uphill phase of figuring out what our approach is and what we’re going to do. Then, once we can see all the work involved, there’s the downhill phase of execution. (reframe it summarizing "progress" stage)

4. **Exploration**: Wandering into uncharted territories, testing our theories, and mapping out the journey ahead. This stage is about uncovering the unknowns and sketching the map ahead.

> Give yourself an hour to just try going in a new direction. After an hour you’ll know for sure why you can’t get there in an hour. Make a note. Take a rest. Then play with whatever blocked your progress.

5. **Execution**: This is where our plans take shape. The tasks are put into motion, and our ideas transform into tangible outcomes. 

> Set your task limit to just a few at a time. Let's say, three. Start working on them. You'll soon understand why you can't juggle more than that effectively. Always bearing in mind the goal is to juggle effectively, not to juggle everything.

#### Section III: Outcome

5. **Completed**: This is the finish line, where tasks are finally crossed off. It's a testament to our success.

> Savour this moment. Look back at what's achieved, but also look forward, carrying with you the lessons learnt. This is both a well-deserved rest and a launch pad for the next endeavor

6. **On Ice**: Some tasks hit a bump. Here, they hibernate, not forgotten, neither remembered.
