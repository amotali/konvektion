# Navigating Tasks & Progress

The nature of our work is ever-evolving, demanding a dynamic balance between focus and flexibility. To keep up, we need a workflow that's as flexible and dynamic as we are. 

Enter a blend of [classic Kanban principles](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wEN8DINqEss) with our own spin, aiming to help building valuable things with ease, filling our working memory with the right things in the right sequence. 

Friends, I present you _Kanbanjan_.

#### 1. No Status

This is the birthplace of all ideas, the "brainstorming hub". Everything starts here, and nothing is too small or too outrageous.

#### 2. To Do

The ideas that make it out of the brainstorming stage land here. They are refined and ready to be worked on. Think of it like a "Up next" in your music queue.

#### 3. Research

Here, we break down tasks, ask questions, find answers, make prototypes. It's a bit challenging, but it prepares us for a smooth implementation.

#### 4. Implementation

Equipped with insights from our research, we turn our ideas into tangible product here. 

#### 5. Done

This is where tasks reach their conclusion. It's a testament to successful work, a zone for well-deserved rest and a launch pad for the next endeavor.

#### 6. Cold Storage

Some tasks might encounter obstacles or their priority may diminish over time. Such tasks are placed here, neither forgotten nor fully remembered, written on ice, offering a chance to reflect on them in the future.

## Notes

#### Tracking Progress

Work in progress has two distinct phases, akin to an uphill and downhill journey. During the **Research** phase, we embark on the uphill climb. It's a time of discovery, probing, and planning. We might need to experiment, take detours, or even hit a few dead ends. Once we're clear about the work involved and have our plan ready, the downhill phase during the **Implementation** phase often feels smoother, like we're coasting towards our goal.

> **Pro-tip**: It's easy to get lost in sea of unknowns. Give yourself an hour to just try going in a new direction. After an hour you’ll know for sure why you can’t get there in an hour. Make a note. Take a rest. Then play with whatever blocked your progress.

#### Limiting Work-in-progress

> **Tip**: Set your task limit to just a few at a time. Let's say, three. Start working on them. You'll soon understand why you can't juggle more than that effectively. 

#### Knowing When to Let Go

We sometimes encounter tasks that turn out to be more challenging or less fruitful than expected. 
In such cases, biggest progress can come from abandoning it. But how to decide? Ask yourself:

- Are we making reasonable progress or it just drains energy on buksavat?
- Is the expected outcome still valuable?
- Are there no more beneficial tasks awaiting attention?

If the answer to these questions is 'no', it might be time to put the task into **Cold storage**. Ask friends if still unsure.

#### Assorted notes

- There will be moments of intensity and calmness in our performance. Enjoy both.
- It's a dance, not a race. Treat this workflow as a [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOOb2XFtQDM) setting the rhythm. Feel the beat and move your own way.
- Again, remember: too many moves at once is cringe; focus is cute; balance, as always, is key. 
- Another thing that is cringe is a guide that doesn't help. Contributions are welcome.
