## Commit messages

Prefix commit messages with emoji code according to type of the change that commit brings.

This makes it easier to visually identify commits when checking history, and helps to be mindful when commiting.

Code: `:feet:`  
Alternatives: :black_cat: :cat2:

- introducing new capabilities
- fixing behavior of existing functionality
- removing a part of existing functionality

E.g. _deleted an endpoint, with related route handler, tests, etc._

### :axe: changes to structure

### ‚ùî other changes

Besides :feet: :axe: and :golf: defined above, where we deal with the part of code that goes to production, there are other types of changes where we deal with documentation, or CI processes, etc.
